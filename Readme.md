# 🎫 Ticket Management System

The Ticket Management System is a web-based application designed to streamline the process of reporting, tracking, and managing technical support requests within an organization. It allows users to create tickets for issues such as hardware, software, or network problems, while administrators can monitor, assign, and update ticket statuses efficiently.
The system helps improve response time, maintain organized records of support requests, and provide transparency in handling reported issues.
